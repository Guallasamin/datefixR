`datefixR` is designed to standardize messy date data, such as dates
entered by different people via text boxes, by converting the dates to R's Date
data type.

This package arose from my own fights with messy date data where dates were
written in many different formats e.g 01-jan-15, 2015 04 02, 10/12/2010 and
more. 

## Installation instructions

`datefixR` is now available on CRAN.

```{R Cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("datefixR")
```

The most up-to-date (hopefully) stable version of `datefixR` can be installed
via

```{R github, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nathansam/fixdateR")
```

If you wish to live on the cutting edge of `datefixR` development, then the
development version can be installed via

```{R, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nathansam/datefixR", "devel")
```

## Package vignette

`datefixR` has a "Getting Started" vignette which describes how to use this
package in more detail than this page. View the vignette by either calling 

```{R, eval = FALSE}
browseVignettes("datefixR")
```

or visiting the vignette on the
[package website](https://www.constantine-cooke.com/datefixR/articles/datefixR.html)

## Usage

```{r example}
library(datefixR)
bad.dates <- data.frame(id = seq(5),
                        some.dates = c("02/05/92",
                                       "01-04-2020",
                                       "1996/05/01",
                                       "2020-05-01",
                                       "02-04-96"),
                        some.more.dates = c("2015",
                                            "02/05/00",
                                            "05/1990",
                                            "2012-08",
                                            "jan 2020")
                        )
fixed.df <- fix_dates(bad.dates, c("some.dates", "some.more.dates"))
knitr::kable(fixed.df)
```

By default, `datefixR` imputes missing days of the month as 01, and missing
months as 07 (July). However, this behavior can be modified via the `day.impute`
or `month.impute` arguments. 

```{R}
 example.df <- data.frame(example = "1994")

fix_dates(example.df, "example", month.impute = 1)
```

Functions in `datefixR` assume day-first instead of month-first when day, month,
and year are all given (unless year is given first). However this behavior can
be modified by passing `format = "mdy"` to function calls.  

## Limitations

The package is written solely in R and seems fast enough for my current use
cases (a few hundred rows). However, I may convert the core for loop to C++ in
the future if I (or others) need it to be faster.
