Description: There are many different formats dates are commonly represented
  with: the order of day, month, or year can differ, different separators ("-",
  "/", or whitespace) can be used, months can be numerical, names, or
  abbreviations and year given as two digits or four. `datefixR` takes dates in
  all these different formats and converts them to R's built-in date class. If
  `datefixR` cannot standardize a date, such as because it is too malformed,
  then the user is told which date cannot be standardized and the corresponding
  ID for the row. `datefixR` also allows the imputation of missing days and
  months with user-controlled behavior.
